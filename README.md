## The Challenge
In the fast-paced world of retail, precise sales forecasts are indispensable. Accurate predictions enable efficient inventory management, reduce waste, and maximize revenue. However, capturing the complexity of store sales data requires advanced techniques

## The Solution
Our solution is built upon the N-BEATS architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed explicitly for time series forecasting. This architecture allows us to model intricate sales patterns, adapt to various store locations, and consider multiple product categories simultaneously. We've also implemented basic and naive models to establish performance benchmarks

## Dataset
In this project, our goal is to predict sales by harnessing a wealth of variables and information. The dataset encompasses the following files:

- train.csv
- oil.csv
- transactions.csv
- stores.csv
- holidays_events.csv
